# CRAN review workflow

Your package will be stored in a different folder depending on its current state
in the review process.The exact meaning of each folder is detailed in one 
article from the 
[R Journal](https://journal.r-project.org/archive/2018-1/cran.pdf):

- **inspect**: this is your first submission or the automated tests found an 
error that requires human review.
- **pending**: the CRAN maintainers are waiting for an action on your side. You 
should check your emails!
- **pretest**: the CRAN maintainers restarted automated tests on your package to
see whether an issue has been fixed by your action or is still here.
- **recheck**: your package seems ready for publication. This step checks 
whether reverse dependencies will still work after the update.
- **publish**: you're all set! Your package has passed the review process and 
will soon be available on CRAN.

This information is summarised in the following diagram by Hadley Wickham,
available in the [cran-stages Github](https://github.com/edgararuiz/cran-stages)
repository:
